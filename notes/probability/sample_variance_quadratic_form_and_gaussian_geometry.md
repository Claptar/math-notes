# Sample Variance as a Quadratic Form and Its Geometry

## Main question

We understand that the sample variance can be written as a quadratic form on coordinate space. But to diagonalise this quadratic form, for example using spectral decomposition or Gram-Schmidt, we need a dot product on the space.

The natural question is:

> Why is it legitimate to use the ordinary Euclidean dot product  
> \[
> x_1y_1+\cdots+x_ny_n?
> \]
>
> And why does Euclidean orthogonality of the diagonalising directions later correspond to independence of the transformed Gaussian random variables?

The answer is that there are two geometries involved:

1. **Euclidean geometry on coordinate space** \(\mathbb R^n\).
2. **Covariance geometry on random variables**, determined by the covariance matrix \(\Sigma\).

These two geometries are not always the same. They become aligned in the special case where the original Gaussian variables are i.i.d. with common variance \(\sigma^2\), because then

\[
\Sigma=\sigma^2 I.
\]

## 1. Sample variance is first a function on coordinate space

Before introducing randomness, take a deterministic vector

\[
x=(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\mathbb R^n.
\]

Its average is

\[
\bar x=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n x_i.
\]

The vector of deviations from the mean is

\[
x-\bar x\mathbf 1,
\]

where

\[
\mathbf 1=(1,\dots,1)^T.
\]

The unnormalised sample variance is

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^2.
\]

This is the squared Euclidean length of the deviation vector:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^2
=
\langle x-\bar x\mathbf 1,\,x-\bar x\mathbf 1\rangle_{\mathbb R^n}.
\]

So the ordinary dot product is not added artificially later. It is already built into the usual definition of sample variance.

---

## 2. The projection matrix

Define

\[
P=I-\frac1n\mathbf 1\mathbf 1^T.
\]

Then

\[
Px=x-\bar x\mathbf 1.
\]

The matrix entries are

\[
P_{ij}
=
\begin{cases}
1-\frac1n, & i=j,\\
-\frac1n, & i\ne j.
\end{cases}
\]

The unnormalised sample variance is therefore

\[
q(x)=x^TPx.
\]

For the usual unbiased sample variance,

\[
S^2(x)=\frac1{n-1}x^TPx.
\]

For the version with denominator \(n\),

\[
S_n^2(x)=\frac1n x^TPx.
\]

The matrix \(P\) is the Euclidean orthogonal projection onto the mean-zero subspace.

---

## 3. The geometric decomposition of coordinate space

Coordinate space decomposes as

\[
\mathbb R^n
=
\operatorname{span}\{\mathbf 1\}
\oplus
\mathbf 1^\perp,
\]

where

\[
\mathbf 1^\perp
=
\left\{x\in\mathbb R^n: \sum_{i=1}^n x_i=0\right\}.
\]

The direction

\[
\operatorname{span}\{\mathbf 1\}
\]

is the direction where all coordinates move together:

\[
(c,c,\dots,c).
\]

This direction contains no variation between coordinates. It only changes the common level of the sample.

The subspace

\[
\mathbf 1^\perp
\]

contains the genuine fluctuations around the mean.

The projection \(P\) satisfies

\[
P\mathbf 1=0,
\]

and if \(x\in\mathbf 1^\perp\), then

\[
Px=x.
\]

So \(P\) kills the mean direction and keeps the fluctuation directions.

---

## 4. Why the Euclidean dot product is natural

The ordinary sample variance treats the coordinates symmetrically and measures deviation using a sum of squares:

\[
(x_1-\bar x)^2+\cdots+(x_n-\bar x)^2.
\]

That is exactly the Euclidean squared norm.

Thus the dot product

\[
\langle x,y\rangle=x_1y_1+\cdots+x_ny_n
\]

is part of the definition of ordinary sample variance.

If we used a different dot product, we would be defining a different statistic. For example, a weighted inner product would give a weighted variance-like quantity.

So it is both legal and natural to diagonalise \(P\) using the standard Euclidean structure on \(\mathbb R^n\), because \(P\) was built from the Euclidean operation of subtracting the orthogonal projection onto the constant-vector direction.

---

## 5. Diagonalising the sample variance quadratic form

Let

\[
u_1=\frac1{\sqrt n}(1,\dots,1).
\]

Then choose any Euclidean orthonormal basis

\[
u_2,\dots,u_n
\]

of the mean-zero subspace \(\mathbf 1^\perp\).

In this basis,

\[
Pu_1=0,
\]

and

\[
Pu_k=u_k,\qquad k=2,\dots,n.
\]

Therefore the diagonal form of \(P\) is

\[
\operatorname{diag}(0,1,\dots,1).
\]

If

\[
x=a_1u_1+\cdots+a_nu_n,
\]

then

\[
x^TPx=a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2.
\]

The first coordinate \(a_1\) is the mean direction. It contributes nothing to sample variance. The remaining coordinates \(a_2,\dots,a_n\) are fluctuation coordinates.

---

## 6. Now introduce the random vector

Let

\[
X=(X_1,\dots,X_n)^T
\]

be a random vector.

The sample variance is the deterministic quadratic form evaluated at the random vector:

\[
S^2=\frac1{n-1}X^TPX.
\]

Let \(U\) be the orthogonal matrix whose columns are

\[
u_1,\dots,u_n.
\]

Define the transformed random vector

\[
Y=U^TX.
\]

Then

\[
Y_1=u_1^TX
=\frac1{\sqrt n}(X_1+\cdots+X_n)
=\sqrt n\,\bar X.
\]

The remaining variables

\[
Y_2,\dots,Y_n
\]

are fluctuation coordinates.

Because \(U\) diagonalises \(P\), we get

\[
X^TPX
=
Y_2^2+\cdots+Y_n^2.
\]

Therefore

\[
S^2=\frac1{n-1}(Y_2^2+\cdots+Y_n^2).
\]

Up to this point, this is just linear algebra plus substitution of a random vector. No independence has been used yet.

---

## 7. Covariance geometry of linear combinations

Now consider the covariance geometry.

For deterministic vectors \(u,v\in\mathbb R^n\), the corresponding linear combinations are

\[
u^TX
\]

and

\[
v^TX.
\]

Their covariance is

\[
\operatorname{Cov}(u^TX,v^TX)
=
u^T\Sigma v,
\]

where

\[
\Sigma=\operatorname{Cov}(X)
\]

is the covariance matrix of the random vector \(X\).

So covariance defines a second geometry on coefficient space:

\[
\langle u,v\rangle_\Sigma=u^T\Sigma v.
\]

This is not necessarily the same as the Euclidean dot product

\[
\langle u,v\rangle=u^Tv.
\]

---

## 8. Why Euclidean orthogonality gives independence in the i.i.d. Gaussian case

Suppose now that

\[
X_1,\dots,X_n
\]

are i.i.d. Gaussian random variables with common variance \(\sigma^2\). Then

\[
\Sigma=\sigma^2 I.
\]

For the transformed variables

\[
Y_i=u_i^TX,
\qquad
Y_j=u_j^TX,
\]

their covariance is

\[
\operatorname{Cov}(Y_i,Y_j)
=
u_i^T\Sigma u_j.
\]

Since \(\Sigma=\sigma^2 I\), this becomes

\[
\operatorname{Cov}(Y_i,Y_j)
=
\sigma^2 u_i^T u_j.
\]

Therefore, in the i.i.d. case,

\[
u_i\perp u_j
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\operatorname{Cov}(Y_i,Y_j)=0.
\]

And because the transformed variables are jointly Gaussian, zero covariance implies independence.

So for jointly Gaussian variables,

\[
\operatorname{Cov}(Y_i,Y_j)=0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
Y_i\text{ and }Y_j\text{ are independent}.
\]

This is the reason Euclidean orthogonality of the diagonalising directions turns into probabilistic independence of the transformed random variables.

---

## 9. The synchronization of the two geometries

In the i.i.d. Gaussian case, the covariance inner product is

\[
\langle u,v\rangle_\Sigma
=
u^T\Sigma v
=\sigma^2 u^Tv.
\]

So it is just a scalar multiple of the Euclidean dot product.

Therefore:

\[
\text{Euclidean orthogonality}
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\text{zero covariance}
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\text{independence, for Gaussian variables.}
\]

This is why the diagonalisation of the sample variance matrix feels perfectly compatible with covariance and independence.

The compatibility is real, but it depends on the covariance matrix being

\[
\Sigma=\sigma^2 I.
\]

That is, the original Gaussian vector must be isotropic, or spherical, up to scale.

---

## 10. What goes wrong in the non-i.i.d. case

If the covariance matrix is not a scalar multiple of the identity, then Euclidean orthogonality does not necessarily imply zero covariance.

For example, suppose

\[
X_1,X_2
\]

are independent Gaussian variables with

\[
\operatorname{Var}(X_1)=1,
\qquad
\operatorname{Var}(X_2)=4.
\]

Then

\[
\Sigma=
\begin{pmatrix}
1&0\\
0&4
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

Take the Euclidean orthogonal vectors

\[
u=(1,1),
\qquad
v=(1,-1).
\]

They satisfy

\[
u^Tv=0.
\]

But the corresponding random variables are

\[
u^TX=X_1+X_2,
\]

and

\[
v^TX=X_1-X_2.
\]

Their covariance is

\[
\operatorname{Cov}(X_1+X_2,\,X_1-X_2)
=
\operatorname{Var}(X_1)-\operatorname{Var}(X_2)
=1-4
=-3.
\]

So even though the coefficient vectors are Euclidean orthogonal, the random variables are not uncorrelated, and therefore not independent.

This shows that Euclidean orthogonality and covariance orthogonality are generally different notions.

---

## 11. The general rule

For a Gaussian random vector

\[
X\sim N(\mu,\Sigma),
\]

two linear combinations

\[
u^TX
\]

and

\[
v^TX
\]

are independent exactly when

\[
u^T\Sigma v=0.
\]

So the probabilistically relevant orthogonality is not usually

\[
u^Tv=0,
\]

but rather

\[
u^T\Sigma v=0.
\]

When

\[
\Sigma=\sigma^2 I,
\]

these two conditions are equivalent.

---

## 12. Consequence for sample mean and sample variance

In the i.i.d. Gaussian case, after choosing the Euclidean orthonormal basis

\[
u_1=\frac1{\sqrt n}\mathbf 1,
\qquad
u_2,\dots,u_n\in\mathbf 1^\perp,
\]

we get

\[
Y_1=\sqrt n\,\bar X,
\]

and

\[
S^2=\frac1{n-1}(Y_2^2+\cdots+Y_n^2).
\]

The variable \(Y_1\) is independent of \(Y_2,\dots,Y_n\), because its coefficient vector is Euclidean orthogonal to the coefficient vectors of the fluctuation directions, and Euclidean orthogonality agrees with covariance orthogonality when \(\Sigma=\sigma^2I\).

Therefore the sample mean is independent of the sample variance in the i.i.d. Gaussian case.

This independence is not just a consequence of diagonalising the sample variance matrix. It also uses the fact that the covariance matrix of \(X\) is proportional to the identity.

---

## Final summary

The sample variance quadratic form lives first on coordinate space:

\[
q(x)=x^TPx,
\qquad
P=I-\frac1n\mathbf 1\mathbf 1^T.
\]

The ordinary Euclidean dot product is natural because sample variance is defined as a sum of squared Euclidean deviations from the constant-vector subspace:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^2.
\]

Diagonalising \(P\) uses Euclidean geometry and gives the decomposition

\[
\mathbb R^n
=
\operatorname{span}\{\mathbf 1\}
\oplus
\mathbf 1^\perp.
\]

When we plug in a Gaussian random vector \(X\), the covariance geometry is governed by

\[
\operatorname{Cov}(u^TX,v^TX)=u^T\Sigma v.
\]

If \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) are i.i.d. with variance \(\sigma^2\), then

\[
\Sigma=\sigma^2I,
\]

so covariance geometry is just Euclidean geometry up to scale.

That is why Euclidean orthogonal diagonalising directions produce uncorrelated, and hence independent, transformed Gaussian variables.

The key point is:

\[
\boxed{
\text{The coordinate dot product and covariance geometry agree only in the isotropic i.i.d. case.}
}
\]
